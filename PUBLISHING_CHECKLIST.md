## üöÄ Publishing Commands

Once all checks pass:

```bash
# 1. Final verification
cargo publish --dry-run

# 2. Publish to crates.io
cargo publish

# 3. Verify publication
cargo search qasa

# 4. Test installation in a new project
mkdir -p /tmp/test-qasa
cd /tmp/test-qasa
cargo init
cargo add qasa@0.1.0
cargo build
```

## üì¢ Post-Publishing Tasks

- [ ] Create GitHub Release for v0.1.0
- [ ] Include CHANGELOG.md content in release notes
- [ ] Verify crate appears on crates.io
- [ ] Verify docs.rs builds successfully
- [ ] Test installation from crates.io
- [ ] Announce release (if applicable)
- [ ] Update project website (if applicable)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Breaking Changes in v0.1.0

Version 0.1.0 includes critical fixes to ChaCha20-Poly1305 implementation:

1. **Order of Operations**: Fixed from `(h * r) + block` to `(h + block) * r`
2. **Key Clamping**: Fixed from word-level to byte-level per RFC 8439

**Impact**: Data encrypted with v0.0.3 **cannot** be decrypted with v0.1.0.

### If v0.0.3 Was Published

If v0.0.3 was previously published to crates.io:

```bash
# Yank the buggy version
cargo yank --version 0.0.3

# File a security advisory
# Document the security issue
```

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Issue: Tests fail due to network restrictions

**Solution**: Tests need to be run on a machine with internet access before publishing.

### Issue: `cargo publish --dry-run` fails

**Solution**: Review the error message and fix issues. Common problems:
- Missing dependencies
- Documentation errors
- Invalid Cargo.toml metadata

### Issue: Package size too large

**Solution**: Review the exclude list in Cargo.toml and ensure test data, benchmarks, and other non-essential files are excluded.
