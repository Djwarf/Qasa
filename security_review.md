## Cryptographic Algorithms

The module implements the following cryptographic primitives:

1. **CRYSTALS-Kyber** (Key Encapsulation Mechanism)
   - Status: NIST-selected post-quantum KEM standard
   - Security Level: Kyber-768 provides 128-bit security level (post-quantum)
   - Implementation: Uses the OQS library bindings

2. **CRYSTALS-Dilithium** (Digital Signature Algorithm)
   - Status: NIST-selected post-quantum signature standard
   - Security Level: Dilithium-3 provides 128-bit security level (post-quantum)
   - Implementation: Uses the OQS library bindings

3. **SPHINCS+** (Hash-based Digital Signature Algorithm)
   - Status: NIST-selected post-quantum signature standard
   - Security Level: Multiple variants from 128-bit to 256-bit security levels
   - Implementation: Uses the OQS library bindings
   - Note: Provides algorithm diversity as a non-lattice-based alternative

4. **AES-GCM** (Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data)
   - Key Size: 256-bit keys (provided by Kyber KEM)
   - Implementation: Uses the aes-gcm Rust crate

5. **Argon2id** (Password-Based Key Derivation)
   - Configuration: Memory: 65536 KB, Iterations: 3, Parallelism: 4
   - Output size: 32 bytes (256 bits)
   - Implementation: Uses the argon2 Rust crate

## Security Properties

The cryptography module provides the following security properties:

1. **Confidentiality**: Achieved through Kyber KEM and AES-GCM encryption
2. **Integrity and Authentication**: Provided by AES-GCM and Dilithium signatures
3. **Forward Secrecy**: Limited, but improved with key rotation policy
4. **Key Protection**: Secure storage with password-based encryption and secure memory handling
5. **Post-Quantum Security**: Protection against quantum computer attacks using NIST-standardized algorithms

## Identified Vulnerabilities

| ID | Severity | Component | Description | Mitigation |
|----|----------|-----------|-------------|------------|
| V1 | Medium | Key Storage | Keys are stored on disk and protected only by passwords | Use stronger password requirements, hardware security modules for production |
| V2 | Low | Key Rotation | Key rotation could fail if metadata is corrupted | Implement backup and recovery mechanisms |
| V3 | Low | Memory Handling | Sensitive data is properly zeroized using the zeroize crate and secure memory APIs | Continuous monitoring to ensure all sensitive data follows secure memory patterns |
| V4 | Low | Random Number Generation | No explicit fallback for RNG failures | Add entropy checking and fallback mechanisms |
| V5 | Low | Password Hashing | Default parameters may be insufficient for certain threat models | Allow application to configure higher security parameters |

## Threat Model Analysis

### Threat Actors

1. **Network Adversaries** (High capability)
   - Can intercept, modify, or inject data in the network
   - Mitigated by authenticated encryption and signatures

2. **Local System Adversaries** (Medium capability)
   - May have access to the filesystem, but not root/admin privileges
   - Mitigated by encrypted key storage with password protection

3. **Quantum Attackers** (Future threat)
   - Attackers with access to large-scale quantum computers
   - Mitigated by post-quantum cryptographic algorithms

4. **Side-Channel Attackers** (High sophistication)
   - Can measure timing, power consumption, or electromagnetic emissions
   - Partially mitigated by constant-time implementations, but more work needed

5. **Memory Dumping Adversaries** (Medium capability)
   - Can obtain memory dumps of the running process
   - Mitigated by secure memory handling with immediate zeroization after use

### Attack Surfaces

1. **Key Storage**
   - Risk: Unauthorized access to stored keys
   - Mitigation: Password-protected encryption, access control

2. **Key Exchange**
   - Risk: Man-in-the-middle attacks
   - Mitigation: Proper authentication mechanism needed for key exchange

3. **Memory Handling**
   - Risk: Recovery of sensitive data from memory
   - Mitigation: Zeroize sensitive data using the zeroize crate, manage sensitive memory in secure containers like SecureBytes, employ scope-based zeroing with with_secure_scope

4. **Random Number Generation**
   - Risk: Predictable random numbers leading to key compromise
   - Mitigation: Use of system secure RNG with proper entropy

## Recommendations

### High Priority

1. Implement secure memory handling throughout the codebase by applying `zeroize` to all sensitive data.
2. Add explicit entropy checks for random number generation.
3. Develop a comprehensive key distribution and authentication system.

### Medium Priority

1. Enhance key rotation with better error handling and recovery mechanisms.
2. Implement perfect forward secrecy for the cryptographic protocols.
3. Add support for hardware security modules for key storage.

### Low Priority

1. Consider additional post-quantum KEM algorithms for KEM diversity.
2. Implement side-channel resistance testing.
3. Add formal verification of critical security properties.

## Post-Quantum Cryptography Considerations

The module correctly implements NIST PQC standardized algorithms, which provides protection against quantum computer attacks. However, these algorithms are still relatively new, and cryptanalysis is ongoing. The system should be designed to allow algorithm upgrades in the future as the post-quantum cryptography landscape evolves.

Key points:

1. The Kyber and Dilithium implementations are based on libraries that follow NIST specifications.
2. The key sizes and parameters are aligned with the 128-bit security level.
3. The hybrid approach of using both AES-GCM and post-quantum algorithms provides defense in depth.

## Compliance and Regulatory Considerations

The implementation supports compliance with:

- NIST SP 800-63B (Digital Identity Guidelines)
- FIPS 140-3 (with appropriate configuration)
- GDPR (for secure storage of user data)

## Conclusion

The QaSa cryptography module implements a strong foundation for post-quantum cryptographic operations. The use of NIST-standardized post-quantum algorithms, combined with proper authenticated encryption and key management, provides a good security posture.

Key improvements needed:
- Secure memory handling throughout the codebase
- Enhanced key distribution and authentication
- Better error handling and recovery mechanisms

With these improvements, the module will be well-positioned for use in cryptographic applications, with protection against both current and future cryptographic threats.
