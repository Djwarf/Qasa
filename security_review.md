## Post-Quantum Cryptography Considerations

The module correctly implements NIST PQC standardized algorithms, which provides protection against quantum computer attacks. However, these algorithms are still relatively new, and cryptanalysis is ongoing. The system should be designed to allow algorithm upgrades in the future as the post-quantum cryptography landscape evolves.

Key points:

1. The Kyber and Dilithium implementations are based on libraries that follow NIST specifications.
2. The key sizes and parameters are aligned with the 128-bit security level.
