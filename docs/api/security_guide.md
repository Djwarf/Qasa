# QaSa Cryptography Module Security Guide

## Introduction

This security guide is designed to help developers understand and properly implement the security features of the QaSa cryptography module. The module provides post-quantum cryptographic protection for secure communications through a carefully selected set of cryptographic primitives and security-focused implementation details.

**Last Updated:** February 2024
**Current Version:** 0.0.4

## Cryptographic Components Overview

QaSa implements a hybrid cryptographic system combining both post-quantum and traditional cryptographic algorithms:

1. **Key Encapsulation**: CRYSTALS-Kyber (NIST PQC standard)
2. **Digital Signatures**: 
   - CRYSTALS-Dilithium (NIST PQC standard, lattice-based)
   - SPHINCS+ (NIST PQC standard, hash-based)
3. **Symmetric Encryption**: AES-256-GCM (with authenticated data)
4. **Key Derivation**: Argon2id (for password-based key derivation)

This hybrid approach ensures security against both classical and quantum attacks while maintaining good performance characteristics.

## Threat Model

### Assumed Threats

The QaSa cryptography module is designed to resist the following types of adversaries:

1. **Network Adversaries**
   - Can intercept, modify, and inject communications
   - May have full control over the communication channel
   - May perform replay, man-in-the-middle, and traffic analysis attacks

2. **System Adversaries**
   - May have access to persistent storage, but not the running process memory
   - May attempt to access stored keys on disk
   - May attempt to recover deleted keys from disk

3. **Quantum Adversaries**
   - May have access to large-scale quantum computers
   - Can run Shor's algorithm to break traditional public key cryptography
   - Can run Grover's algorithm, effectively halving symmetric key security

4. **Side-Channel Attackers**
   - May attempt timing attacks to extract key information
   - May analyze power consumption or electromagnetic emissions
   - May perform cache-timing and other microarchitectural attacks

### Security Boundaries

The following are outside the security boundary of the cryptography module:

1. **Physical Security**: The module cannot protect against physical access to hardware
2. **Operating System**: The module assumes the operating system is not compromised
3. **Key Generation**: The module relies on the operating system's secure random number generator
4. **Password Quality**: The module cannot enforce strong passwords chosen by users

## Security Features

### Post-Quantum Resistance

All cryptographic operations use algorithms designed to resist attacks from quantum computers:

- **Kyber** uses lattice-based cryptography which is believed to be resistant to quantum attacks
- **Dilithium** provides signature security against quantum adversaries using lattice-based cryptography
- **SPHINCS+** provides signature security using hash-based cryptography, offering algorithm diversity
- **AES-256** provides sufficient security margin against Grover's algorithm (effectively 128-bit security against quantum attacks)

### Authenticated Encryption

All encryption operations use AES-GCM, which provides:

- **Confidentiality**: Messages remain secret from unauthorized parties
- **Integrity**: Any modification to ciphertext will be detected
- **Authentication**: Proof that the message came from a trusted source

The module provides functions to handle both encryption and signatures in a single operation (`encrypt_and_sign_message` and `decrypt_and_verify_message`).

### Key Management

The module includes a comprehensive key management system:

- **Secure Storage**: Keys are stored encrypted with password-derived keys
- **Key Rotation**: Automatic or manual key rotation with configurable policies
- **Key Backup**: Export/import functionality with password protection
- **Key Verification**: Methods to verify key pair validity

### Memory Security

The module implements secure memory handling to protect sensitive data in memory:

- **Zeroization**: All sensitive buffers are zeroed when no longer needed
- **Secure Containers**: Special container types like `SecureBuffer` and `SecureBytes` for sensitive data
- **Scope Guards**: The `with_secure_scope` function ensures data is zeroized even if a function returns early or panics

## Security Best Practices

### Key Handling

1. **Never store raw keys in persistent storage**
   ```rust
   // WRONG: Storing raw keys
   fs::write("private.key", &keypair.secret_key)?;
   
   // CORRECT: Use the secure storage functions
   let key_id = store_kyber_keypair(&keypair, Some(temp_path), "strong_password")?;
   ```

2. **Use secure memory for sensitive operations**
   ```rust
   // WRONG: Using standard Vec for sensitive data
   let shared_secret = keypair.decapsulate(&ciphertext)?;
   
   // CORRECT: Using SecureBytes for sensitive data
   let shared_secret = SecureBytes::new(keypair.decapsulate(&ciphertext)?);
   ```

3. **Implement key rotation policies**
   ```rust
   // Create a high security rotation policy
   let policy = RotationPolicy {
       rotation_interval_days: 30,
       ..Default::default()
   };
   
   // Check if keys need rotation
   let rotated_keys = auto_rotate_keys(
       |_key_id| password.to_string(),
       Some(temp_path),
       policy,
   )?;
   ```

### Authentication and Integrity

1. **Always verify signatures before processing messages**
   ```rust
   // WRONG: Decrypting without verifying
   let plaintext = aes::decrypt(&encrypted, &key, &nonce, None)?;
   
   // CORRECT: Verifying and decrypting
   let is_valid = public_key.verify(message, &signature)?;
   if is_valid {
       let plaintext = aes::decrypt(&encrypted, &key, &nonce, None)?;
   }
   ```

2. **Use AAD (Associated Authenticated Data) when relevant**
   ```rust
   // Encrypt with AAD to bind contextual data to the encryption
   let (ciphertext, nonce) = aes::encrypt(
       message, 
       &shared_secret, 
       Some(conversation_id.as_bytes())
   )?;
   ```

### Password Handling

1. **Use strong parameters for key derivation**
   ```rust
   // WRONG: Using default parameters
   let derived = derive_key_from_password(password, None, None)?;
   
   // CORRECT: Using high-security parameters
   let params = high_security_params();
   let derived = derive_key_from_password(password, None, Some(&params))?;
   ```

2. **Implement proper password requirements**
   - Minimum length: 12 characters
   - Mix of character types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols)
   - No common passwords or patterns
   - Regular password changes

### Randomness

1. **Never use custom random number generators**
   ```rust
   // WRONG: Rolling your own RNG
   let timestamp = SystemTime::now().duration_since(UNIX_EPOCH)?.as_secs();
   let key = hash(timestamp.to_string());
   
   // CORRECT: Use the provided secure random functions
   let random_bytes = utils::random_bytes(32)?;
   ```

2. **Use fresh nonces for each encryption**
   ```rust
   // WRONG: Reusing nonces
   let nonce = [0u8; 12];
   
   // CORRECT: Generate a new nonce for each encryption
   let nonce = AesGcm::generate_nonce();
   ```

## Implementation Patterns

### Secure Communication Pattern

For implementing secure end-to-end communication:

```rust
use qasa::prelude::*;

// Initialize the crypto module
init()?;

// [SETUP PHASE]
// Generate keys for Mary and Elena
let mary_enc_keys = KyberKeyPair::generate(KyberVariant::Kyber768)?;
let mary_sig_keys = DilithiumKeyPair::generate(DilithiumVariant::Dilithium3)?;

let elena_enc_keys = KyberKeyPair::generate(KyberVariant::Kyber768)?;
let elena_sig_keys = DilithiumKeyPair::generate(DilithiumVariant::Dilithium3)?;

// Exchange public keys (via a secure channel initially)
let mary_enc_pub = mary_enc_keys.public_key();
let mary_sig_pub = mary_sig_keys.public_key();

let elena_enc_pub = elena_enc_keys.public_key();
let elena_sig_pub = elena_sig_keys.public_key();

// [ALICE SENDS TO BOB]
// Create a secure message from Mary to Elena
let message = b"Hello Elena, this is a secure message from Mary!";
let secure_message = create_secure_message(
    message, 
    &elena_enc_pub,
    &mary_sig_keys,
)?;

// [BOB RECEIVES FROM ALICE]
// Elena opens the secure message from Mary
let decrypted = open_secure_message(
    &secure_message,
    &elena_enc_keys,
    &mary_sig_pub,
)?;

assert_eq!(&decrypted, message);
```

### Key Storage Pattern

For securely storing and loading keys:

```rust
use qasa::prelude::*;

// Store keys with password protection
let password = "strong_unique_password";
let kyber_key_id = store_kyber_keypair(&kyber_keypair, None, password)?;
let dilithium_key_id = store_dilithium_keypair(&dilithium_keypair, None, password)?;

// Later, load keys when needed
let loaded_kyber = load_kyber_keypair(&kyber_key_id, password)?;
let loaded_dilithium = load_dilithium_keypair(&dilithium_key_id, password)?;

// Set up key rotation
let rotation_policy = RotationPolicy::high_security();
let new_kyber_key_id = rotate_kyber_keypair(&kyber_key_id, password)?;
```

### Secure Memory Pattern

For handling sensitive data in memory:

```rust
use qasa::prelude::*;

// Use SecureBytes for sensitive data
let mut secret_key = SecureBytes::new(&keypair.secret_key);

// Data is automatically zeroized when dropped
{
    let temp_secret = SecureBytes::new(b"temporary secret");
    // ... use temp_secret ...
} // temp_secret is automatically zeroized here

// Use secure scope for temporary sensitive data
let mut key_data = vec![0u8; 32];
with_secure_scope(&mut key_data, |data| {
    // Fill with sensitive data
    random_bytes_into(data)?;
    // ... use data ...
}); // data is zeroized here, even if an error occurred
```
