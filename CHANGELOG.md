## [0.1.0] - 2025-10-21

### BREAKING CHANGES

**ChaCha20-Poly1305 Implementation Fixes - RFC 8439 Compliance**

This release fixes critical bugs in the ChaCha20-Poly1305 implementation to achieve full RFC 8439 compliance. Unfortunately, these fixes break backward compatibility with data encrypted using version 0.0.3.

#### What Changed

Two critical bugs were fixed in the Poly1305 MAC implementation:

1. **Corrected Order of Operations** (fixed in commit 99b0665)
   - **Old behavior (v0.0.3):** Computed `(h * r) + block` (INCORRECT)
   - **New behavior (v0.1.0):** Computes `(h + block) * r` (CORRECT per RFC 8439)

2. **Corrected Key Clamping** (fixed in commit 890fdbe)
   - **Old behavior (v0.0.3):** Word-level clamping after byte conversion (INCORRECT)
   - **New behavior (v0.1.0):** Byte-level clamping per RFC 8439 specification (CORRECT)

#### Impact

- Data encrypted with **v0.0.3 CANNOT be decrypted** with v0.1.0
- Data encrypted with **v0.1.0 is RFC 8439 compliant** and interoperable with standard implementations
- The v0.0.3 implementation used a non-standard algorithm with unknown security properties
- The v0.1.0 implementation is cryptographically sound and standards-compliant

#### Migration Guide

If you have data encrypted with v0.0.3, you have two options:

1. **Re-encrypt your data:**
   - Decrypt with v0.0.3
   - Re-encrypt with v0.1.0
   - Store the new ciphertext

2. **Use a dedicated key/nonce for new data:**
   - Keep old data encrypted with v0.0.3 (maintain separate key/nonce)
   - Use new keys/nonces for v0.1.0 encrypted data

**Security Recommendation:** We strongly recommend re-encrypting all data with v0.1.0, as the v0.0.3 algorithm was non-standard and has not been cryptanalyzed.

#### Why This Change Was Necessary

- **Security:** The old implementation violated RFC 8439 and used an unvalidated algorithm
- **Interoperability:** The new implementation can interoperate with other RFC 8439 compliant implementations
- **Standards Compliance:** Following established cryptographic standards is critical for security

For more details, see `INVESTIGATION_REPORT.md`.

### Added
- Comprehensive investigation reports documenting the RFC 8439 compliance issues
- Test vector verification against RFC 8439 Section 2.8.2

### Fixed
- ChaCha20-Poly1305 Poly1305 order of operations to match RFC 8439 specification
- ChaCha20-Poly1305 key clamping to use byte-level masks per RFC 8439
